# CurbTheVirus
# Introduction
Since the time SARS CoV-2 hit India last summer, there have been countless deaths and subsequently, countless attempts of developing vaccines or other methods to save lives. One of the promising treatments turned out to be Convalescent Plasma Transfusion therapy. A person affected by Covid-19 may be able to start building antibodies within, with the help of infusion of convalescent plasma, derived from a person fully recovered from Covid-19.
This treatment, even though proven effective to a satisfactory level, remains to be a relatively unorganized matter. Hence, paving the need of a centralized platform, to connect convalescent plasma seekers with willing donors, Curb The Virus web app aims to do exactly that.
This project is nothing but a web-based platform that lets both plasma seekers and willing plasma donors register themselves onto the platform. Then, plasma seekers can see a list of matching, available and eligible donors in their dashboards and then request to contact donors, which if accepted by the donors in their dashboards, will allow plasma seekers to contact donors. Both parties can then coordinate according to their schedules to make suitable arrangements, Curb The Virus web app provides an undertaking form to be signed by all parties using the platform before undergoing the plasma transfusion therapy. Thus, acting as a platform to help connect plasma seekers with willing donors.
