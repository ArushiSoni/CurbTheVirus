    <p style={{fontSize: 'medium', textAlign: 'justify'}}>Most people can give plasma if they are in good health. There are some basic requirements one  need to fulfill in order to become a plasma donor.  Below are some basic eligibility guidelines:</p>
    <p style={{fontSize: 'medium', textAlign: 'left'}}><b>Age:</b><br />
      You are aged between 19 and 60.<br />
      *In some states, legislation permits 16–17 year-olds to donate provided that they fulfil the physical and hematological criteria required and that appropriate consent is obtained.<br />
      *In some states, regular donors over the age of 65 may be accepted at the discretion of the responsible physician/ doctor. The upper age limit in some states are 60.
    </p>
    <p style={{fontSize: 'medium', textAlign: 'left'}}><b>Weight:</b><br />
      You weigh at least 50 kg.<br />
      *In some states, donors should weigh at least 45 kg to donate 350 ml ± 10% .<br />
    </p>
    <p style={{fontSize: 'medium', textAlign: 'left'}}><b>Health:</b><br />
      You must be in good health at the time you donate.<br />
      You cannot donate if you have a cold, flu, sore throat, cold sore, stomach bug or any other infection.<br />
      If you have recently had a tattoo or body piercing you cannot donate for 6 months from the date of the procedure.  If the body piercing was performed by a registered health professional and any inflammation has settled completely, you can donate plasma after 12 hours.<br />
      If you have visited the dentist for a minor procedure you must wait 24 hours before donating; for major work wait a month.<br />
      You must not donate plasma If you do not meet the minimum haemoglobin level for plasma donation<br />
      * A test will be administered at the donation site. In many states, a haemoglobin level of not less than 12.0 g/dl for females and not less than 13.0 g/dl for males as the threshold.<br />					</p>
    <p style={{fontSize: 'medium', textAlign: 'left'}}><b>Travel:</b><br />
      Travel to areas where mosquito-borne infections are endemic, e.g. malaria, dengue and Zika virus infections, may result in a temporary deferral.<br />
    </p>
    <p style={{fontSize: 'medium', textAlign: 'left'}}><b>Behaviours:</b><br />
      <b>You must not give plasma:</b><br />
      If you engaged in “at risk” sexual activity in the past 12 months<br />
      Individuals with following behaviours below will be deferred permanently:<br />
      Have ever had a positive test for HIV (AIDS virus)<br />
      Have ever injected recreational drugs.<br />
      *In the national plasma donor selection guidelines, there are more behavior eligibility criteria. Criteria could be different in different states.
    </p>
    <p style={{fontSize: 'medium', textAlign: 'left'}}><b>Pregnancy and breastfeeding:</b><br />
      Following pregnancy, the deferral period should last as many months as the duration of the pregnancy.<br />
      It is not advisable to donate plasma while breast-feeding. Following childbirth, the deferral period is at least 9 months (as for pregnancy) and until 3 months after your baby is significantly weaned (i.e. getting most of his/her nutrition from solids or bottle feeding).<br />
